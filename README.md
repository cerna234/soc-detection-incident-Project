# SOC Detection & Incident Analysis Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a small-scale Security Operations Center (SOC) lab focused on centralized log collection, threat detection, and incident analysis. The lab simulates realistic attack scenarios and analyzes them using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform and industry-standard frameworks.

The goal of this project is to develop hands-on SOC skills that align with real-world blue team operations and graduate-level cybersecurity coursework.
